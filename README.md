Rokko MVC
=========
@Author Rodrigo Formigone Silveira http://www.rodrigo-silveira.com

An awesome PHP MVC Framework designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind.

Framework goals:
 * Provide a light-weight, flexible, and secure application framework
 * Provide an elegant way to organize application code - multiple applications can share the framework's core libraries
 * Help newcomers to Model-View-Controller paradigm get used to concepts easily

Framework features:
 * Very, very modular
 * Models, controllers, and custom libraries can be namespaced and still get autoloaded
 * Easily configured from a single configuration file
 * Heavily documented with PHPDocs
 * Build using Test Driven Development, giving the framework a higher degree of reliability, confidence, and predictability
